- **Notes**: Excellent independent solution! Used smart first digit check (4 or 9) to separate basic symbols from subtractive cases. Working solution with clean structure, then learned greedy optimization. Shows significant problem-solving improvement.
- **Approach**: Original - separate mappings with first digit check; Optimized - combined greedy approach
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - maximum 13 symbols possible
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - fixed size data structures
- **Tags**: independent-solution, first-digit-check, greedy-optimization, problem-solving-growth, string-building
