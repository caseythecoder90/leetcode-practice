# LeetCode Study Repository

This repository is organized to help prepare for coding interviews by practicing LeetCode problems.

## Organization Structure

Each pattern has its own package with the following structure:

```
pattern/
├── README.md           # Pattern overview, tips, and resources
├── CheatSheet.md       # Quick reference for the pattern
├── problems/          # Individual problems within this pattern
│   ├── Problem1/      # One directory per problem
│   │   ├── README.md  # Problem description, approaches, and complexity analysis
│   │   ├── Solution1.java  # First solution approach
│   │   └── Solution2.java  # Alternative solution approach
│   └── Problem2/
└── common/            # Common utilities or helper classes for this pattern
```

## Patterns

- Arrays
- LinkedList
- Trees
- Graph
- DynamicProgramming
- Backtracking
- SlidingWindow
- TwoPointers

## How to Use

1. Study the pattern README.md for an overview
2. Reference CheatSheet.md for quick pattern techniques
3. Work through individual problems in the problems/ directory
4. Implement multiple solutions when possible to understand tradeoffs
