# Arrays Pattern

## Overview

Array problems are fundamental in coding interviews. This package contains problems that focus on array manipulation, searching, sorting, and other array-based techniques.

## Key Techniques

- Iterating with single and multiple pointers
- Using additional data structures (hash maps, sets)
- Sorting and binary search
- Prefix sums
- Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray
- In-place manipulation

## Common Time/Space Complexities

- Linear scan: O(n) time, O(1) space
- Sorting: O(n log n) time, O(1) or O(n) space depending on algorithm
- Using hash map/set: O(n) time, O(n) space
- Binary search: O(log n) time, O(1) space
