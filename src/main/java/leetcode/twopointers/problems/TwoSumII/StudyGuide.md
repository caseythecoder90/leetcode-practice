# Study Guide: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

## Why This is the Perfect Two-Pointers Problem

The Two Sum II problem is **THE** textbook example of how sorted arrays enable constant-space two-sum solutions:

1. **Exploits Sorted Property**: Array being sorted is key to algorithm efficiency
2. **Constant Space Constraint**: Forces us to use two-pointers over hash map
3. **Optimal Solution**: O(n) time, O(1) space is absolutely optimal
4. **Natural Convergence**: Pointers start far apart and naturally converge
5. **Guaranteed Solution**: Removes edge case worries

## Core Algorithm Pattern: Converging Two-Pointers

The most fundamental two-pointers pattern:
```java
int left = 0;
int right = array.length - 1;

while (left < right) {
    int current = array[left] + array[right];

    if (current == target) {
        return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // Found!
    } else if (current < target) {
        left++;  // Need larger sum
    } else {
        right--; // Need smaller sum
    }
}
```

## Mathematics Behind the Algorithm

### Why This Works: Mathematical Induction
Consider a sorted array `[a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ ... ≤ aₙ]` and target `T`:

1. **Base Case**: If `a₁ + aₙ == T`, done!
2. **Inductive Step**: Suppose we have `a[i] + a[j] ≠ T`
   - If `a[i] + a[j] < T`, then for any `k < i`, `a[k] + a[j] ≤ a[i] + a[j] < T`
   - If `a[i] + a[j] > T`, then for any `k > j`, `a[i] + a[k] ≥ a[i] + a[j] > T`
3. **Therefore**: We can safely eliminate either `a[i]` or `a[j]` from consideration

### Geometric Interpretation
```
Array: [2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 15]
Target: 9

Current pair: (2,15) = sum 17 > 9
  ↓
Need smaller sum: eliminate 15
Move right to 11: (2,11) = 13 > 9
  ↓
Need smaller sum: eliminate 11
Move right to 7: (2,7) = 9 == 9
  ✓
Solution found!
```

## Algorithm Visualization: Step-by-Step

### Visual Walkthrough of `[2,7,11,15]` with target `9`:

| Step | Left | Right | Sum | Comparison | Action | Status |
|------|------|-------|-----|------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | 15 | 17 | 17 > 9 | Move right left | Continue |
| 2 | 2 | 11 | 13 | 13 > 9 | Move right left | Continue |
| 3 | 2 | 7 | 9 | 9 == 9 | **SOLUTION!** | Return [1,2] |

### Early Termination Case: `[2,3,4]` with target `6`:

| Step | Left | Right | Sum | Comparison | Action | Status |
|------|------|-------|-----|------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 6 == 6 | **SOLUTION!** | Return [1,3] |

## Alternative Solutions Analysis

### 1. Your Original Solution (Optimal!)
```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = numbers.length - 1;

    while (i < j) {
        int currentSum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];

        if (currentSum == target)
            return new int[] {i + 1, j + 1};

        else if (currentSum < target) i++;

        else j--;
    }

    return new int[] {-1, -1};
}
```
**PERFECT!** This is the most elegant and efficient solution.

### 2. Binary Search Approach (Alternative)
```java
public int[] twoSumBinarySearch(int[] numbers, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - numbers[i];
        // Binary search for complement in remaining array
        int left = i + 1, right = numbers.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (numbers[mid] == complement) {
                return new int[]{i + 1, mid + 1};
            } else if (numbers[mid] < complement) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```
**Analysis**: O(n log n) time, still O(1) space, but slower than two-pointers.

### 3. Hash Map Approach (NOT ALLOWED HERE)
```java
public int[] twoSumHashMap(int[] numbers, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - numbers[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement) + 1, i + 1};
        }
        map.put(numbers[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```
**Analysis**: O(n) time, O(n) space - violates constant space constraint!

## Why Two-Pointers Beats Binary Search

### Performance Comparison:
- **Two-Pointers**: O(n) time, O(1) space
- **Binary Search**: O(n log n) time, O(1) space

### Why Binary Search is Slower:
- **Multiple Binary Searches**: One for each element
- **Log Factor**: log(3×10⁴) ≈ 15, so 15x slower in worst case
- **Cache Performance**: Two-pointers is more cache-friendly
- **Early Termination**: Two-pointers can terminate immediately on success

### Real Performance Impact:
```
Array Size: n = 30,000
- Two-Pointers: ~30,000 operations
- Binary Search: ~450,000 operations (15x more!)
```

## Pattern Recognition Framework

### When to Use Converging Two-Pointers:

1. **Sorted Input**: Array/list is pre-sorted
2. **Constant Space**: No extra data structures allowed
3. **Exact Matching**: Need to find elements that satisfy a condition
4. **Optimal Solution**: Want absolute best time/space complexity
5. **Single Pass**: Can solve in one traversal

### Signature Characteristics:
- Start from both ends: `left = 0, right = n-1`
- Compare current sum/pair with target
- Move pointers inward based on comparison result
- Continue until pointers meet or solution found

## Common Two-Pointers Problems Using This Pattern

### Classic Converging Problems:
- **Two Sum II** (this problem) - Find pair with specific sum
- **Find Target in Pivoted Array** - Search in rotated array
- **Minimum Size Subarray Sum** - Find shortest subarray ≥ target
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating** - Expanding window variant

### Subtle Variants:
- **Squares of Sorted Array** - Sort squared elements
- **Remove Duplicates** - In-place modification
- **Move Zeroes** - Partition array elements
- **Reverse Vowels** - Conditional swapping

## Interview Question Extensions

### Follow-up Questions You Might Face:

1. **What if duplicates aren't allowed?**
   - Skip duplicate elements when moving pointers

2. **What if we need all pairs, not just one?**
   - Continue searching after finding first pair

3. **What if array isn't sorted?**
   - Can't use this approach, fall back to hash map

4. **What about large numbers (overflow)?**
   - Use `long` for sum calculation

5. **What if target is very large/small?**
   - Algorithm still works, just more iterations

### Handling Edge Cases:
```java
// Robust edge case handling
public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
    if (numbers == null || numbers.length < 2) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
    }

    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        // Use long to prevent integer overflow
        long currentSum = (long)numbers[left] + numbers[right];

        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    // Problem guarantees solution exists
    throw new IllegalStateException("No solution found");
}
```

## Algorithm Complexity Deep Dive

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- **Expected Case**: O(n) - Find solution somewhere in middle
- **Worst Case**: O(n) - May need to examine all elements
- **Best Case**: O(1) - Solution is at the ends

### Space Complexity: O(1)
- **Only Variables**: 2 integer pointers + temporary sum
- **No Scaling**: Fixed space regardless of input size
- **Memory Efficient**: Perfect for large arrays

### Runtime Characteristics:
- **Predictable Performance**: No worst-case surprises
- **Cache-Friendly**: Sequential memory access
- **Branch Prediction Friendly**: Simple comparisons

## Your Solution: Why It's Perfect

### What Makes Your Code Excellent:

1. **Minimal Code**: Clean, concise implementation
2. **Correct Logic**: Perfect pointer movement strategy
3. **Proper Indices**: Correct 1-based indexing
4. **Edge Case Ready**: Handles constraints perfectly
5. **Optimal Performance**: Nothing faster possible

### Intuitive Thinking Process:
```java
// Your thought process was spot-on:
if (array is sorted) AND (must use O(1) space) THEN (use two pointers)

// Start with extremes:
// - Sum too large? → Move right pointer left (smaller number)
// - Sum too small? → Move left pointer right (larger number)
// - Sum equals target? → Found it!
```

## Performance Optimization Insights

### Maximizing Performance:
1. **Simple Variables**: Use primitive types, not objects
2. **Bit Operations**: Consider using shifts instead of multiplication
3. **Early Termination**: Structure code for immediate returns

### For Competitive Programming:
- **Fast Input/Output**: If dealing with very large inputs
- **Bit Manipulation**: For integer targets within range
- **Inline Functions**: Avoid method call overhead

## Real-World Applications
